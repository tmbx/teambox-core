# pyPgSQL API reminder:
# - The connection object supports the functions commit(), rollback() and
#   close(). The functions commit() and rollback() can be called many times
#   without causing an error.
# - The cursor object has the attribute 'rowcount' which contains the number of
#   rows returned by the last statement executed.
# - The cursor object has the method fetchone() which returns a single row of
#   results or 'None' if there are no more results.
# - The row object can be indexed by column number or by column name.
# - Do not use PgSQL.PgQuoteBytea(). It doesn't work.

# This function returns a connection object for the Postgres database specified.

# This function opens a transaction if no transaction is currently open,
# executes the statement specified and returns the cursor containing the results
# of the statement. The transaction is kept open after the statement has been
# executed. It must be rolled back or commited manually. Note that doing either
# of these actions invalidates the cursor returned by this function. In other
# words, it is not possible to have a valid cursor without having also an open
# transaction. Hence, try not to forget to commit the transaction after each
# statement.
